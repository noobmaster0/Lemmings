# Description
A simple recreation of lemmings that I made for my game development class.\
Itch.io page https://noobmaster0.itch.io/lemmings-recreation

# Template
I used https://github.com/meemknight/SFMLCmakeSetup as a template for the cmake.\
If it gives an error about openAL copy the thirdparty folder from the template into the project.
